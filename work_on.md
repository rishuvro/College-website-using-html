## Design a website for a College. There should be at least 5 web pages present in
the website. There should be:
· One Home page that leads to other pages. The Home page should contain the
name of the college as heading along with the college logo. There should be a tab with
the following links:

· Home;
· Academics;
· Admission;
· Gallery.

· There should be an appropriate description of the college on the home page.
· One Academics page which contains a list of all the departments present in the
college Arts, Science and Commerce. The list should be nested, with available courses
mentioned under each department. There should be a minimum of two courses under
each department, (for e.g. Computer Science and Mathematics under Science, English
and Sociology under Arts and so on). Each Course entry in the list should be a HTML
link that leads to a web-page totally dedicated to the course itself.
· Each Course should have its own dedicated web-page. This page should contain a
description about the course, a list of all the teachers taking the course and the
timetable for that particular subject.
· The Admission page basically contains a form that a student needs to fill up in
order to take admission in the college. The form should ask all the necessary questions
using appropriate form elements.
· One gallery page that contains set of photos taken of the college and its students.
Please note that each web-page in this website should have the same
background Image/color. The looks of each page should be similar.
